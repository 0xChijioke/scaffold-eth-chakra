# Happiverse 🏗 Scaffold-ETH

[Happiverse](https://behappi.surge.sh/) is made up of two smart contracts, Smile.sol and Happi.sol which are deployed on Rinkeby for now. 

This build is a composition of the [composable-svg-nft]( https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth/tree/composable-svg-nft), and [oe-loogie-tank](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth/tree/oe-loogie-tank-prod) branches of schaffold-eth.


This Scaffold-eth buidl is based on the idea of on-chain composable NFTs, where on-chain nfts hold other nfts, the possibilties of this concept is endless.
Forks this buidl and thinker around with it locally!


Any nft that implements the `public` render function can be rendered into the Happiverse, this is possible because Happi.sol inherits the `IERCReciever` which allow this nft to recieve and render other nfts that implement the `public` render fuction.


```
 // to receive ERC721 tokens
  function onERC721Received(
      address operator,
      address from,
      uint256 smileTokenId,
      bytes calldata happiIdData) external override returns (bytes4) {

      uint256 happiId = toUint256(happiIdData);
      require(ownerOf(happiId) == from, "you can only add smiles to your own happi.");
      require(smileById[happiId].length < 256, "Excess joy! Cant take anymore.");

      smileById[happiId].push(smileTokenId);

      bytes32 randish = keccak256(abi.encodePacked( blockhash(block.number-1), from, address(this), smileTokenId, happiIdData  ));
      x[smileTokenId] = uint8(randish[0]);
      y[smileTokenId] = uint8(randish[1]);
      blockAdded[smileTokenId] = block.number;

      return this.onERC721Received.selector;
    }
```

Smiles can transfered to Happi and is rendered because it implements the `public` render function which allows other contracts to render its data.


```
// Visibility is `public` to enable it being called by other contracts for composition.
  function renderTokenById(uint256 id) public view returns (string memory) {
    string memory render = string(abi.encodePacked(
      '<g transform="translate(60 60)"><circle r="50" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" fill="#',
      color[id].toColor(),
      '"/><circle cx="-20" cy="-10" r="5"/><circle cx="20" cy="-10" r="5"/><path fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="3" stroke-linecap="round" d="M-20 15c0 20 40 20 40 0"/></g>'
     
        ));

    return render;
  }
```

# 💌 P.S.

🌍 You need an RPC key for testnets and production deployments, create an [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) account and replace the value of `ALCHEMY_KEY = xxx` in `packages/react-app/src/constants.js` with your new key.

📣 Make sure you update the `InfuraID` before you go to production. Huge thanks to [Infura](https://infura.io/) for our special account that fields 7m req/day!
